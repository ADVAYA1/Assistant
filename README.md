## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ADVAYA1/Assistant.git](https://github.com/ADVAYA1/Assistant.git)
    cd Assistant
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The backend requires a set of environment variables to function correctly.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory: `backend/.env`
2.  Add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection
    MONGO_DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # JWT Secret Key
    JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_secret_key

    # Cloudinary Credentials
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # Google Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

    # Server Port
    PORT=8000
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you specified).

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    * In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite chooses).
