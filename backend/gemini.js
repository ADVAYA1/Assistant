import axios from 'axios';


const geminiResponse = async (command,assistantName,userName) => {

    try {
        const apiUrl = process.env.GEMINI_API_URL;

        const prompt=` You are a virtual assistant named ${assistantName} created by ${userName}. 
        You are not Google. You will now behave like a voice-enabled assistantName.
        Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond with a JSON object like this:
        {
            "type": "general" | "google-search" | "youtube-search" | "youtube-play" |
            "get-time" | "get-date" | "get-day" | "get-month" | "calculator-open" |
            "instagram-open" | "facebook-open"  |
            "weather-show",  

            "userInput": "<original user input>" {only remove your naem from userinput if
                exists} and agar kisi ne google ya youtube pe kuch search karne ko bola hat toh to
                userInput me only wo search wala text jaye,

                "response": "<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
            }

            Instructions:
            - "type" : determine the intent of the user.

            - "response" :A short voice-friendly reply, e.g., "Sure, playing it now", "Here what i found",
            "Today is Tuesday", etc

            Type meanings:
            -"general": if it's a factual or informational question. aur agar koi aisa question puchta hai jiska aswer tumhe pata hai usko bhi general ki category me rakho bas short answer dena.
            -"google-search": if the user wants to search something on Google.

                "parts":[{
                    "text": prompt
                }]
